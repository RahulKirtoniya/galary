The objective of this project was to create a picture gallery application that showcases skills in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and API integration by retrieving and displaying pictures from Unsplash.com. 

Approach:

HTML Structure: The project began with setting up the basic HTML structure. We created an HTML file to house the application's content, including a header with a search input field, a search button, and a main content area for displaying the gallery.

CSS Styling: To make the application visually appealing, a CSS file was used to style the header, search container, and the picture gallery. Styles were applied to create a responsive grid layout for the images.

JavaScript Functionality: JavaScript was employed to handle user interactions and make API calls to Unsplash.com. We used the Fetch API to request pictures based on the user's category input. The retrieved images were dynamically added to the gallery with associated author information and links.

API Key Integration: An essential part of the project was obtaining an API key from Unsplash. We securely integrated this key into our JavaScript code to authenticate and access the Unsplash API.

Challenges Faced:

API Integration: Integrating the Unsplash API required careful attention to authentication and understanding the API's data structure. Rate limits and pagination also needed consideration.

Conclusion:
This project allowed for the demonstration of skills in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and API integration to create a functional and visually appealing picture gallery application. While there were challenges in integrating the Unsplash API and ensuring responsiveness, the final product successfully met the specified requirements and can be further improved and expanded in the future.
